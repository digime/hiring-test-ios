Digi.me iOS Tech Test

## Hello fellow iOS Developer ðŸ‘‹
We're really happy you are insterested in joining our iOS team at digi.me.

This is quite an open-ended task, but the point of it is to demonstrate your thinking process, problem solving skills and ability to produce functionally correct, maintainable and testable code. We are looking for a clean, well factored Swift codebase.

You can assume the device running will be connected to internet.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out - we are here to help and want you to succeed!

## The task
It should take no more than 4 hours to complete the minimum requirements below. You can spend longer if you are having fun :)

### Overview
We would like you to build a GIPHY search app.

The App must:

- Allow the user to enter a search term
- Use [GiphyAPI](https://developers.giphy.com/) to perform live search on user's entered term
- Display search results
- Allow user to tap on a GIF to see basic GIF information, such as creation date, author, rating and title

### Requirements

- **Data**: Efficiently process GIPHY API JSON response
- **UI / App**: The app needs to work in portrait mode, using iOS 13+. The rest is up to you
- **Tests**: Write no more than `3` tests to cover what you feel are the most important aspects of the app
- **Documentation**: Include a `README` that includes:
	- Roughly how long you took
	- Any special instructions on how to build and run the app
	- A list of "Things I would include / do differently if I had more time"
	- Rationale for using any 3rd party libraries (if any)
	- Detail any bugs, issues you didn't get a chance to fix
	- Any other comments / notes we should consider as part of your application

### Language
As much as we love Objective-C, please submit your project in Swift :).

## Completion
Share your private Github repo with the user `@digimetest`.

Please also include your name in the repository description so that we know whose code we're looking at.

After we have considered your submission you may be asked to discuss your solution over a zoom call.

Best of luck and we look forward to speaking with you soon!
